# Dynamic Social Media Feed

A real-world, production-ready application that simulates a dynamic social media feed, emphasizing efficient data fetching, real-time user engagement, and a highly responsive, mobile-first design.

Built using the **Next.js** framework and leveraging **GraphQL** for efficient and flexible data management.

## Overview & Goals

This project is a deep dive into building modern, user-centric front-end applications. It mirrors a common industry scenario where efficient data hydration and superior user experience are paramount.

The primary objectives of this project are:

1. **Dynamic Data Loading:** Implement **GraphQL queries** for highly performant and targeted data fetching, displaying posts with smooth loading indicators.

2. **Real-Time User Engagement:** Develop interactive features such as **liking, commenting, and sharing** posts, ensuring real-time state synchronization with the back-end.

3. **Enhanced Experience (UX/UI):** Create a **fully responsive** and visually appealing interface that delivers a seamless experience across all devices, with smooth transitions and optimistic UI updates.
